# restaurant-page

This project was created with the use of webpack to get more familiar with DOM manipulation to dynamically render this website. Featuring a menu so savory that you'd wish this was a real restaurant!

## Challenges
This project was created with the use of webpack. Having built this website without relying on HTML elements was tricky at first but slowly got use to this dev flow and how to organize my files for the future. Another challenge I encounter was trying to use Google's map API since I wasn't sure how to connect the API key and not expose it at the same time to the public at first. I manage to learn a lot about how API works and getting the data I needed.

## Build With
- Vanilla JS
- HTML5
- CSS
- Webpack

## Special Features
- A google map of my family's restaurant, which already has its own website so I decided to base this webpage on foods from one of my favorite game ^-^
- It's Responsive !
